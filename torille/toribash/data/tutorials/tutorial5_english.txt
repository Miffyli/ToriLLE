#PLAYER MESSAGES
SENSEIMSG1	This time, you are going to practice your comeback skills.

SENSEIMSGFAIL	Oh, I think I fell asleep. Come on, you can do much better!
SENSEIMSGEND1	One hit is better than nothing, but you sure can improve that! Try again!
SENSEIMSGEND2	Nice work, that was... %d times you hit Uke. But you can still do better, keep training!
SENSEIMSGEND3	Great job, you hit Uke %d times! Keep working on your skills and you'll be a comeback master!

#HINT MESSAGES
HINT1	You will start in slightly modified LENSHU mod. Unlike AIKIDO, here you can touch the floor with any bodypart - but only for a short period. However, stay inside the dojo - stepping outside will instantly get you disqualified!
