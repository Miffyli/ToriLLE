#PLAYER MESSAGES
SENSEIKICK1	Now that you know how to use your arms, it's time to learn how to kick your opponents using legs.
SENSEIKICK2	I'll guide you through this simple kick.
SENSEIKICK3	Hold all joints to prevent yourself from falling down.
SENSEIKICK4	This will be a left leg kick. Contract both your hip and knee to get in position.
SENSEIKICK5	All right, now finish your turn by pressing space.
SENSEIKICK6	Good, now you're ready to kick the opponent. Extend your knee and look at your ghost!
SENSEIKICK7	Pay attention that despite being able to kick dummy's leg, your body bends forwards, making you vulnerable to opponent's attacks.
SENSEIKICK8	There's a way to fix that by extending your right hip. That would also make the kick stronger, so it's a win-win situation!
SENSEIKICK9	Finish your turn and see what you did!
PLAYERKICK1	Hiiya!
SENSEIKICK10	That's nice! Always remember to check your ghost to preview your move before finishing the turn!
SENSEIADVKICK1	Simplest kick is mastered, but to face real opponents you need to learn how to use your whole body.
SENSEIADVKICK2	This may seem too complicated at first, but eventually you'll feel what you need to do without memorizing moves.
SENSEIADVKICK3	Almost there!
SENSEIADVKICK4	Marvelous! Now come here, I've got something special for you.
SENSEIMOVEMEMORY1	At first, memorizing your moves to execute them against real opponents may be complicated.
SENSEIMOVEMEMORY2	Here, take MoveMemory. It would help you to store and run your recorded moves.
SENSEIMOVEMEMORY3	For convenience, I already added moves you learned earlier to it.
SENSEIMOVEMEMORY4	Give it a try.
SENSEIMOVEMEMORY5	That's right, now you're prepared for your first real fight!

#HINT MESSAGES
HINTADVKICK1	To land the high kick, you'll need to use your GLUTES, TORSO and even ARMS to increase the momentum.\nBut first, hold your whole body by pressing ~C~
HINTADVKICK2	Replicate the kick sensei taught you: contract left hip and knee to raise the leg and get in position and extend right hip to give your move a boost.
HINTADVKICK3	Now RIGHT ROTATE your body and move the right arm forwards.\nRotating top parts of your body in the opposite direction of the kick would give you additional momentum.
HINTADVKICK4	To raise your leg even higher, you need to use glutes.\nExtend both by pressing ~Z~ and see what it does.
HINTADVKICK5	Here comes the trial and error part - applying final changes to your kick's direction.\nIn our case, LUMBAR joint will be especially helpful.
HINTADVKICK6	Try bending lumbar to the right.
HINTADVKICK7	You can see that while your kick now seems to be more powerful, it shifted slightly lower.\nThis can be useful when you intend to make a body kick, but now we're aiming for the head.
HINTADVKICK8	This time, try bending lumbar to the left to see what changes.
HINTADVKICK9	This made the kick go even higher than before so you'll be able to hit the dummy freely.\nPress ~SPACE~ to end your turn.
HINTADVKICK10	Time to finish the kick! Extend your KNEE to hit the dummy and finish the turn!
HINTMOVEMEMORY1	To open MOVEMEMORY, press ~M~
HINTMOVEMEMORY2	Select any move you'd like to execute and press ~SPACE~ to see the magic happen!
HINTMOVEMEMORY3	MoveMemory allows doing moves without touching any joints manually.\nWith its help, you can save yourself time if you want to do a move you've already done before.
HINTMOVEMEMORY4	To close MoveMemory, press ~M~ again.
