#PLAYER MESSAGES
SENSEIMSG1	Welcome to your first real test!
SENSEIMSG2	Your opponent will be Uke, and you'll be playing aikido - one of the most popular mods.
SENSEIMSG3	This challenge is very similar to how your Multiplayer Fights would look like.
SENSEIMSG4	Good luck and remember everything you've learned!
SENSEIMSG5	Welcome back and have fun with your training!
UKEWIN1	Ha-ha, take that!
UKEWIN2	And I come victorious!
UKEWIN3	Wow, that was close. Pffft, kidding!
UKEWIN4	Whoops, did you just lose? So sorry ...not!
UKELOSS	Ugh. Not fair!
SENSEIMSGEND	Great job! Now you are ready to join other fighters across the world!
GMANKICK	That was a simple aikido kick by Gman80. Nice job, I'll add it to your MoveMemory.
FNUGGETKICK	With this move, I tried to lift you with my arm and trip with my right leg. You can use it now.
EVILTHROW	With this move, you can throw your opponents to the floor! Try it with Movememory some time.
KYATKICKLIFT	This move type is called kicklift. Using it, you can push your opponents out from dojo!
EVILPUSH	Evilperson taught me this floor push - and it's in your Movememory now, too.
EVILPUSH2	That dojo push was one of evilperson's moves. Guess I still have to practice it.
