# ToriLLE
Toribash Learning Environment. Extra "L" to make words more memorable for Finns ("Torille" = "To the marketplace").

ToriLLE provides learning agents an interface to video-game [Toribash](http://www.toribash.com/), a humanoid fighting game.
Toribash provides environment for MuJoCo-like humanoid control, specifically aimed for competitive gameplay. This makes
ToriLLE suitable for e.g. self-play experiments. 

ToriLLE comes with a Python interface and pre-made OpenAI Gym environment with various tasks. Following white-paper includes baseline experiments and benchmarks conducted using ToriLLE: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10110)

## Requirements
Tested to work on Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04 and MacOS 10.13. Tested on Python versions 3.5 and 3.6, and will likely not work on 2.7. 

* Numpy (Python)
* FileLock (Python)
* [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) (For Linux/MacOS. **Requires modern version. Tested on 3.0.3**)

## Quickstart
Remember to install [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) if you are on Linux or MacOS. Make sure `wine` command is defined.

Following will download ToriLLE with stripped down version of Toribash:
```
pip install torille
```

Random agent:
```python
from torille import ToribashControl
from torille.utils import create_random_actions

# Show gameplay
toribash = ToribashControl(draw_game=True)
toribash.init()

# Random agent
while 1:
    state, t = toribash.get_state()
    if t: break
    toribash.make_actions(create_random_actions())
toribash.close()
```

OpenAI Gym environment:
```python
import gym
import torille.envs

env = gym.make("Toribash-DestroyUke-v0")
# Show gameplay
env.set_draw_game(True)

initial_state = env.reset()
t = False
# Random agent
while not t:
    s, r, t, _ = env.step(env.action_space.sample())
env.close()
```

## Manual installation 

You can install ToriLLE without PyPI/pip with the following:

* Install [Toribash](http://toribash.com/) (note: Only Steam version may be up to date)
* Copy contents of `toribash-codes` to Toribash installation directory. Overwrite files
  * **Note:** This will prevent using that specific installation as a regular game. Remove/rename `profile.tbs` file 
               to revert most of the changes and use game normally again.
  * **Note2:** Starting with Toribash 5.4 / Steam version of Toribash, settings file is stored in under user's directory at
               `Saved Games/Toribash/custom.cfg`. Toribash loads this file by default if it finds it, which may cause 
               ToriLLE to run in wrong settings.
* Provide path the installed `toribash.exe` when creating `ToribashControl` objects (if you use provided Python library)

## Playing in multiplayer

**Note: Multiplayer does not work on Linux Wine!**

Want to try your agents against human players in multiplayer? Check how [manual remote control](docs/manual_torille.md) works.


## Documentation

Examples in `examples` provide quickstart to how to use ToriLLE, and also show how to apply settings or 
record replays.

For references see:

* [Python library](docs/torille.md)
* [Gym environment](docs/envs.md)

For troubleshooting, see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md).

If you wish to modify ToriLLE or use other language to control Toribash instance, see [hacking](docs/hacking.md) and [documentation on protocol](docs/protocol).
